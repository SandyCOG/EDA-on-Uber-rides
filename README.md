# EDA-on-Uber-rides-New

This project analyzes uber rides taken by the donor across different countries. There are 7 columns and 1156 entries. The aim of the project was to discover trends across the dataset. Some insights gotten from the analysis include:
- The minimum duration of a trip was 0s. This could be either because the driver or the passenger cancelled the ride before it began or values were not properly calculated. The maximum duration of a trip was 5 hours 36 minutes, however, the start and stop locations are unknown.
- The maximum number of miles travelled was 310.3 miles from Latta to Jacksonville, however it has a shorter duration that the previously unknown trips. The minimum miles travelled was 0.5 miles, mainly to run errands/get supplies.
- December was the busiest month with 146 rides and September was the least busy month with 36 rides.
- Most of the trips made were for Business purposes.
- Other than rides for unknown purposes, the top three purposes for a ride were Meetings — 187, Meals/Entertainment — 160 and Errands/Supplies — 128.
- Fridays were the busiest days of the week for the rider.
- The top five known Start and Stop locations are: Cary, Morrisville, Whitebridge, Islamabad and Durham. The first 3 are located in North Carolina, USA and we can deduce that the rider either lives in North Carolina or does a lot of businesses in the city. The fourth location is in Pakistan and the fifth location — Durham is located in England. Unknown locations make up the second largest in the count which could either be from privacy or error in data entry.
